# The relationship between House Investment and Economic Environment #
## Summary of description ##
In comparison with the extensive literature on house prices, housing investments study far less. This paper investigates the behavior of private residential investments for the states under different economies. An appropriate theory that can be employed to think about such data and associated research questions has lacked. I demonstrate the topic on the following steps: how to present economic environment by macroeconomic variables; how does house investment perform in changes of the financial condition; how to calculate the regional ratio of house investment to personal income. Besides, I document substantial inertia in-house financing and find that the changes in economic environment risk factors affect house prices and house investment gradually rather than immediate impact. Then, the multivariable linear regression model can be used to explore whether any real relationship is in regional house price sensitivity to household income, and the relative economic condition of different regions. Problems cause the result with the regression as previous research that indicated that relatively more prosperous areas do have a higher ratio of house prices to household income.
